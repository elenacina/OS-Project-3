# OS-Project-3
This project is developed as part of Operating Systems course.
We implemented a Linux kernel	module to	get and	print	memory	management information for	a process. The module	retrieves  the required	 information from the	related kernel data structures: the	PCB	of	the	process,the	memory management	data	structure of	the	process, and	the	top	level	page table of	the process.

The module will be inserted with insmod comand and will take one argument,a	process	identifier.
